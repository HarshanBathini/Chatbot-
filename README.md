# Chatbot-
The SimpleBot is a basic chatbot implemented in C that engages users in text-based conversations. It utilizes keyword matching to generate responses, allowing for simple interactions on various topics. The chatbot can greet users, answer questions about its identity, and provide assistance with programming-related queries. It features a random response selection mechanism to enhance conversational variety and avoid repetitive replies. Users can interact with the bot through a command-line interface, typing their messages and receiving responses in real-time. The bot recognizes specific commands, such as greetings and farewells, and can gracefully exit the conversation upon user request. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental programming concepts, such as string manipulation, control structures, and basic data structures in C. It can be further enhanced by expanding the knowledge base, implementing more complex natural language processing techniques, or integrating network capabilities for remote interactions. Overall, SimpleBot provides a foundational experience in chatbot development and programming in C.
